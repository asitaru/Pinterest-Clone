# Pinterest-Clone
Personal Project using Express, GraphQL, MongoDB, React, Redux. While some technologies used in here can be considered
overkill (such as GraphQL, Redux), the purpose of the project is learning/improving.

You can view it live at https://react-pinterest.herokuapp.com/

TODO

- Move boostrap and any FE dependencies in their separate yarn/bower config file, delete bootstrap.css
- Implement React Router
- Add Redux
- Move to relational db and implement filter by pins
- Add socket based GraphQL
- MasonryJS has performance issues with React, investigate for a library that allows Pinterest style layout
